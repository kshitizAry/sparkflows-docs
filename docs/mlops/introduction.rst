Introduction
======

Sparkflows MLOps allows you to deploy Machine learning models. These models can be either built in Sparkflows or models built outside of Sparkflows can also be onboarded and served.

The models in Sparkflows can be served as one of the two options:

#. **Offline Model Serving**

    * Usually used for batch scoring
    * Used for bulk prediction
    * Has high throughput

#. **Online model serving**
   
    * Usually used for scoring streaming data 
    * Low latency
    * Real time model serving
    * Used on relatively smaller number of rows of data
