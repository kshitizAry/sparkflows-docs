Backup and Recovery
------

This document explains the steps involved in backing up and recovering of data in Fire Insights using either H2 database (H2 DB) or MySQL Database (MySQL DB).

Data Storage on H2 DB and MySQL DB
==================================

Fire Insights stores the metadata into a Relational Database.

It comes with an embedded H2 database (H2 DB). It scales well for pretty heavy loads and upto 50 users. Sparkflows can be easily configured to run with a MySQL database.

When running with the H2 database, Sparkflows, by default, stores the database files in the user home directory which is running Sparkflows. There are 2 files :

- firedb.mv.db	
- firedb.trace.db

For backup, just copying these files to a backup location is enough. There is no need to stop Sparkflows. It is a good idea to copy it to another machine.


When configured with MySQL, the MySQL database named ``Fire`` needs to be backed up manually or by enabling RDS Auto Backup feature.

Automate Backup of H2 DB
================

This section enlists detailed steps for automate backup of H2 DB.

Fire Insights enables Administrator to avail options for Automate Backup of H2 DB from UI and can be stored on same VM or in S3 bucket if its accessible from Fire Inisghts Machine.

Below are the detailed steps. 

Login to update path for backup location
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Login to ``Fire Insights`` application -> ``Administration`` -> ``Configurations`` -> ``app.db.backup.location`` -> and update path where you want to take backup:

::


    app.db.backup.location : /home/sparkflows

.. note:: The path updated should have sufficient permission to write. You may configure S3 bucket if Fire Insights have sufficient privilege to write.
