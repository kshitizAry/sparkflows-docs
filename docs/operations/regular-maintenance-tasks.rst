Regular Maintenance Tasks
==============

It is important to do a few maintenance tasks regularly to have Fire Insights running smoothly over time.

Commands cheatsheet for H2 DB is available at : https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/commands/h2-db.html


Backing up H2 DB
----------------

Fire Insights can be run with the embedded H2 DB, or when an external database like MySQL, SQL Server etc.

It is important to back up the database regularly.

In order to backup the H2 DB follow the steps below:

* Stop Fire Insights
* Copy the H2 DB files to another folder. This file is normally named firedb.mv.db.
* Start Fire Insights


Cleaning H2 DB
--------------

Fire Insights by default uses the H2 embedded database.

It is important to keep the size of the database in control. All the Fire Insights tables are relatively small except those which store the result of workflow execution.

Cleaning Old Workflow Executions

* Use the commands below for compacting it::

    java -cp ~/fire-x.y.z/db/h2/h2-1.4.199.jar  org.h2.tools.Shell
    URL: jdbc:h2:./firedb
    Driver : org.h2.Driver
    User : fire
    Password : fire

    SHUTDOWN COMPACT
