Workflows
=========

PGP Decryption
++++

Use the PGP Decryption node. It will run the decryption in parallel on the cluster and it would be much faster.


Scala & Pyspark Nodes
++++

Limit the use of Scala and Pyspark Nodes where possible. Instead us the nodes available for the implementation.

It would make it easier to maintain the system in the long run.
