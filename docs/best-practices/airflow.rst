Airflow
=======

Long DAGs
++++
  
Do not have long DAGs. This would cause the Airflow to run many parallel tasks and become unstable.

Instead, divide the DAGs into smaller, more manageable components.


Manage Sensors Effectively
++++
**Use Timeout and Soft Failures**: Set timeouts for sensors to avoid them running indefinitely. Use the poke_interval parameter to control how frequently sensors check for conditions.


Optimize Task Parallelism
++++
**Limit Parallel Tasks**: Too many parallel tasks can overwhelm the scheduler and worker nodes. Set appropriate concurrency limits for your DAGs and tasks.

DAG Concurrency: This refers to the maximum number of task instances that can run concurrently within a single DAG.

``dag = DAG( 'example_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily', concurrency=5 # Limit to 5 concurrent tasks in this DAG )``
