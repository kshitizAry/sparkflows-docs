Postback Url 
=========

I do not see anything after submitting the job to Emr Livy
------------------------------------------------------------

Do check in the logs for exceptions and the root cause. The log files can be used from Livy url.

Possible causes are:

* The Postback Url configured in Fire Insights is configured wrongly.
* The Postback Url configured in Fire Insights is not accessible from EMR Livy.
