Github Connectivity
====

- Issue: **Workflow not getting pushed to Github**
   - Description: User pushes the project changes from workflows editor. But the Git repo doesn't reflect the latest changes.
   - Resolution: Check if the User has the write permission. Sometimes user is given Developer permission in Github instead of Maintener and this leads to the above issue.
