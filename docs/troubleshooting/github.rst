Issue: Workflow not getting pushed to GitHub
--------
**Description:** User pushes the project changes from the workflows editor. But the Git repo doesn't reflect the latest changes.

**Resolution:** Check if the User has the write permission. Sometimes user is given Developer permission in GitHub instead of Maintainer and this leads to the above issue.
