Sharing Projects
================

A project can be shared with multiple groups. A project is visible only to those users who belong to the groups with whom it has been shared with.

Below is shared a project with the ``DEFAULT`` group:

   :alt: security
   :width: 60%

The following permissions can be given to a group during sharing of the project:

.. figure:: ../../_assets/security/project-shared-permission.png
   :alt: security
   :width: 60%

All users belonging to the group get the associated permissions on the project.
