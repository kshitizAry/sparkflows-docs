Connections

Connections enable access to various resources. Connections can be at various levels:

  * Global:  Everyone has access to these connections.
  * Group:   Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * Project: The owner of the project and the groups with which the project has been shared with have access to the project level connections.
