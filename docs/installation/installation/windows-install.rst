Windows Installation using TGZ file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sparkflows can be installed to run independently on Windows.



Prerequisites
====================

Below are the Prerequisites for installing Fire Insights on a windows machine::


  - JDK 8 installed.
  - java and jar have to be in the PATH
  - 8+ GB of RAM on the machine.
  

Check JDK 8 is installed
====================

* Check the JDK version installed on your machine::

    Open the command window 
    Type the following command to check your java version : java -version

* If JDK 8 is not installed, follow the JDK installation steps mentioned below.


Install JDK 8
====================

* Download JDK 8 for windows using the link below:

  * https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

* Install java by double clicking on the downloaded exe file

* After installation, make sure that java 8 is in the path::

    Open a new command window 
    Type the following command to check your java version : java -version

.. note::  If you have multiple versions of Java installed on you system, you can update the PATH using the steps outlined in either of the links below:

           * https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10
           * https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml
           
 
.. note:: With the above steps, you would have Fire Insights running locally on your laptop. It would not be able to submit jobs to a Spark cluster. For that, Fire Insights has to be installed on the edge node of the cluster.


Install winutils.exe
====================

winutils.exe is needed for running Apache Spark/Hadoop on windows machines. Follow the below steps to setup winutils.exe on your machine

   
- Download winutils.exe from https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils

      - winutils.exe can be directly downloaded from link below:
      - https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils/blob/master/hadoop-2.7.1/bin/winutils.exe
  
- Create hadoop folder in Your System : ``C:\hadoop``.

hadoop.dll
====================

hadoop.dll is needed for running Apache Spark/Hadoop on windows machines. Follow the below steps to setup ''hadoop.dll'' on your machine

- Download hadoop.dll from 
    * https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils/blob/master/hadoop-2.7.1/bin/hadoop.dll
 
- Copy ''hadoop.dll'' to ''windows/system32'' folder and restart the system.

.. note:: Make sure to download the appropriate version



Troubleshooting
====================

Running into an exception when saving files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 1 in stage 33.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 1.0 in stage 33.0 (TID 131, localhost): java.io.IOException: (null) entry in command string: null chmod 0644 
    
If you run into an exception like above, then there is problem with the setup of ``winutils.exe``.



Installation
=================

Fire Insights can be installed to run independenly on Windows.


Installation Steps of Fire Insights with H2 DB
----------------------------------------------

* Download the fire tgz file from:

  * https://www.sparkflows.io/download
  
  
* Unpack the downloaded tgz file. Below are some tools which can be used for it::

    WinRar : https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm
    WinZip : https://www.winzip.com
    7-Zip : https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

    
* Create H2 DB::

    cd <fire install_dir>
    .\create-h2-db.bat
    
* Launch Fire Server::

    cd <fire install_dir>
    .\run-fire-server.bat start

* Open your web browser and navigate to:: 
  
    <machine_name>:8080

* Login with:: 

    admin/admin or test/test

    
    
.. note::  Two user accounts come preconfigured with Fire Insights.

           * admin/admin
           * test/test
    
    You may change these usernames and passwords in Fire under the menu Administration/Users 

Stopping Fire Insights
=================

Stopping the Fire Server
------------------------

Stop the Fire Server with the below::

    .\run-fire-server.bat stop


Stopping Fire Helper Processes
-------------

Stop Fire helper processes with the below::

    .\run-fire.bat stop


.. note::  On Windows, the PySpark engine will not get installed. Below are he functionalities that will not be available on bare metal windows install. We recommend either docker on windows to access all functionalities or install Fire Insights on Linux

           * AutoML
           * Prophet
           * ARIMA
           * Scikit learn models
           * Keras/Tensorflow models
           * A few other python native packages.
