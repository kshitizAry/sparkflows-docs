Fire Insights Deployment 
================

Fire Insights can easily be deployed on a standalone machine. It supports linux, mac and windows. The jobs can run on the local machine. Or it can be configured to connect to a Databricks, AWS EMR, AWS Glue, Cloudera, Azure HDInsights, Google Cloud Dataproc or any Apache Spark cluster.

Deployment on a Standalone Machine
----------------------------------

In this mode, Fire is installed on a mac/windows/linux machine. All the executions happen on that machine, in the web server.

This mode can be used for:

* Designing workflows to be finally deployed on a larger Apache Spark cluster.
* For analyzing smaller sets of data.

Deployment on AWS
-----------------

When deploying on AWS, Fire Insights is installed on an EC2 machine. It can be configured to connect with an EMR cluster or AWS Glue.

Fire Insights can also be configured to connect with Databricks clusters.

Deployment on Azure
-----------------

When deploying on AWS, Fire Insights is installed on a VM. It can be configured to connect with an Azure HDInsights Cluster.

Fire Insights can also be configured to connect with Databricks clusters.

Deployment on GCP
-----------------

When deploying on GCP, Fire Insights is installed on a VM. It can be configured to connect with Google Cloud Dataproc clusters.

Fire Insights can also be configured to connect with Databricks clusters.

Deployment on an Apache Hadoop/Apache Spark Cluster
-------------------------------------

The clusters could be based on the Apache Hadoop distribution from Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR or any other Hadoop cluster distributors. The cluster can be on-premise or on the cloud.
