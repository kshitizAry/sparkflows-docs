Fire Insights Deployment 
================

Fire Insights can easily be deployed on a standalone machine. It supports linux, mac and windows. The jobs can run on the local machine. Or it can be configured to connect to a Databricks, AWS EMR, AWS Glue, Cloudera, Azure HDInsights, Google Dataproc or any Apache Spark cluster.

Deployment on a Standalone Machine
----------------------------------

In this mode, Fire is installed on a mac/windows/linux machine. All the executions happen on that machine, in the web server.

This mode can be used for:

* Designing Workflows to be finally deployed on a larger Apache Spark Cluster.
* For analyzing smaller sets of data.


Deployment on an Apache Hadoop/Apache Spark Cluster
-------------------------------------

The clusters could be based on the Apache Hadoop distribution from Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR or any other Hadoop Cluster distributors. The cluster can be on-premise or on the cloud.
