Fire Insights Configuration
===========================

In order to scale out, multiple machines running Fire Insights can be configured under a load balancer.

In this case an external database has to be used for Fire Insights. All of the Fire servers under the load balancer would be connecting to the same database instance.

There are additional configurations needed for each Fire server in such a scenario.

application.properties
----------------------

Add the following parameters in application.properties of each Fire server. This is to enable it to know its IP address.
Restart Fire Insights server after making the changes.
