Configure security settings
--------

Select default certificate.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision and store server certificates. If you previously stored a server certificate using IAM, you can deploy it to your load balancer.

::

    Certificate type
    Certificate name
    Security policy

Select security policy
--------

::

    Security policy : Select existing or create new security policy.
   

* Configure routing.

::

    Target group
    Name : A name of target group
    Target type :  Instance
    Protocol : HTTPS
    Port :443
    Protocol version : HTTP1
    Register Target
    
Port forwarding
-------

Fire Insights by default runs on port 8080 for HTTP & 8443 for HTTPS. Make sure to forward HTTP or HTTPS to specified ports on which Fire Insights is running.

::

    sudo firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=443:proto=tcp:toport=8443 --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
