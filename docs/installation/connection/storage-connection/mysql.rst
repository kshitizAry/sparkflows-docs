MySQL Connection
================

Sparkflows provides the capability to create MySQL connection and use the connection to access various resources.

Connections can be created at various levels:

* Global  : Everyone has access to these connections
* Group   : Users belonging to a group will only have access to these connections
* Project : The owner of the project and the groups with which the project has been shared with have access to these connections

Below are steps on how to create MySQL Connection:

1. Login to Sparkflows as an ``Admin``. Click on ``Administrator`` tab from main menu. Click on  ``Global Connections`` and then click on ``Add Connection`` and fill in the details as shown below to create the connection.
