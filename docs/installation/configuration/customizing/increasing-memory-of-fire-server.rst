Increasing Memory of Fire Server
================================

When the Fire web server is started with ``run-fire-server.sh``, it is given ``1.5 GB of memory`` by default.

Below is from ``run-fire-server.sh``::

    nohup ${JAVA} -server -Djava.ext.dirs=./user-lib/ -Xmx1548m -Xms1356m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -jar ./app/fire-ui-1.3.0.war --spring.config.name=application,db,log4j --spring.config.location=file:./conf/ &

* In order to increase the amount of memory for the Fire web server, ``increase the value of -Xmx`` based on the amount of memory available on your server.

* For example, you could raise it to 5 GB or 10 GB or more, up to 25 GB.

  * -Xmx5g
  * -Xmx10g
  * -Xmx25g
  
* The increased memory size, if available, allows Fire to handle more requests and return results faster. Of course, when connected to an Apache Spark cluster, the full jobs are submitted to the Spark cluster through spark-submit, allowing it to be very scalable and not dependent on the Fire web server.

* The interactive execution of the workflows in the workflow editor, is run within Fire on a small subset of the data. These interactive executions would benefit from increased memory.
