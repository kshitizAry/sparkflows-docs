Scheduling Workflows
====================

Fire allows you to schedule workflows to be run at regular intervals through its built in Scheduler.

Scheduling New Workflow
-----------------------

Select ``Schedule`` option from Action column

The workflows page displays the list of various workflows. On the workflows page, in the ``Action`` column, there appears a ``Schedule`` option in the action menu that schedules any given workflow.

Editing a Scheduled Workflow
----------------------------

You can edit a schedule by clicking on the ``Edit`` icon and then updating the new values, and saving it from the Scheduled Workflows page.


Viewing Results of the Workflow Executions
--------------------------------------

When workflows are scheduled, they are executed by Fire at the specified schedule.

The results of the execution of the workflows can be viewed in the Workflow Executions Page. This allows us to view the results of the past execution, logs of the run, etc.

Click on the ``Delete`` icon next to any Scheduled workflow to delete the schedule.
