Generative AI Overview
=======

Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence which can be used to generate various contents such as texts, videos, images and so on. 

In Sparkflows we have strong Gen-AI implementations to build good quality textual contents, to perform Sentiment Analysis, NLQ implementation and so on. 

Some of the implementations are as below:

* Product Review
* Sentiment Analysis
* NLQ Implementation
* Document Translation
* Document Summarization
* Chatbot Creation Using A Document Content

**How Generative AI is implemented using Sparkflows (Gen-AI Tasks - Text Generation)**

* Generative AI connection needs to be established pointing to a LLM model provided by Open AI, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude 2 or others.
* Generative AI enabled Analytical Apps needs to be built using the Gen-AI connection established. 
* Analytical App needs to be configured to submit prompt, data and other details to the LLM Model.
* Analytical App needs to be provide facility to receive and display the content generated by LLM Model.

**How Generative AI is implemented using Sparkflows (Sentiment Analysis)**

* Generative AI connection needs to be established pointing to a LLM model provided by Open AI, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude 2 or others.
* Some of the models such as ones provided by Hugging Face can be downloaded for Sentiment Analysis. Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis processor in Sparkflows can be configured to use the downloaded models or can use the model url to perform Sentiment Analysis.
* These processors can be used in a workflow. 
* On execution of the workflow HF processors performs Sentiment Analysis on the data passed (created by a text file content). HF processors makes a call to the HF Model to achieve this.
* Workflow can be executed in stand alone mode or can be called from an Analytical App.
