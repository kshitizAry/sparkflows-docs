Workflow Execution Result
==========================

 
The result of Workflow Execution is continuously streamed to the browser while tasks are getting executed. These response are displayed in rich format in the Execution page when they are streamed. This is specifically important  as some workflow may run for a very long time for compute intensive tasks.

The result of past executions can also be viewed on the Workflow Executions page as below :
