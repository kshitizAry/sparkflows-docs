   * - Title
     - Description
   * - Cast To Different Types-1
     - It casts specified columns to different datatypes as specified.

Cast To Different Types-1
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Cast To Different Types-1`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates the usage of ``Cast To Different Types-1`` node to cast columns to different datatypes.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming dataset.
*	Casts columns from incoming dataset to different datatypes using ``Cast To Different Types-1`` node.
*	Prints output dataset with columns casted to different datatypes using the Print node.

**Cast To Different Types-1 Node configuration**

*	``Cast To Different Types-1`` node is configured as below.
*	Input of this node are the incoming dataset.
*	Column that needs to be casted to different datatype is to be selected in the ``Columns`` list.
*	Datatype to which Column needs to be casted is to be selected in the ``New Data Type`` list.
*	``Replace Existing Cols`` needs to be selected as ``True`` if casted column is needed to replace the existing column in the output.
*	A ``Variables List`` row needs to be added for each casting requirement.
*	Output of this node would display dataset with columns casted to different datatypes.

Cast To Different Types-2
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Cast To Different Types-2`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates the usage of ``Cast To Different Types-2`` node to cast columns to different datatype in the specified format.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming dataset.
*	Casts columns to different datatype in the specified format using ``Cast To Different Types-2`` node.
*	Prints output dataset with columns casted to different datatype in the specified format using the Print node.

*	Column that needs to be casted to different datatype is to be selected in the ``Columns`` list.
*	Datatype to which Column needs to be casted is to be selected in the ``New Data Type`` list.
*	``Replace Existing Cols`` needs to be selected as ``True`` if casted column is needed to replace the the existing column in the output.
*	Format of the output data is to be specified in ``Formats`` box.
*	A ``Variables List`` row needs to be added for each casting requirement.
*	Output of this node would display dataset with columns casted to different datatype in the specified format.

Cast To Single Type
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Cast To Single Type`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates the usage of ``Cast To Single Type`` node to cast selected columns to single datatypes.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming dataset.
*	Casts selected columns to single datatypes using ``Cast To Single Type`` node.
*	Prints output dataset with columns casted to single datatype using the Print node.
