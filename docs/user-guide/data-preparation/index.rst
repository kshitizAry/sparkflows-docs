Data Preparation
===========================

Data preparation is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing a dataset so that it can be used for further analysis or modeling. The goal of data preparation is to make the data consistent, accurate, and in a format that is suitable for the intended analysis or modeling task.



Fire Insights provides a capability to perform the most complex data preperation operation via drag and drop.
