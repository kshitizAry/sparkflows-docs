   * - Title
     - Description
   * - Cube
     - Cube Node computes aggregations of a group of rows against all possible combinations of values in the selected grouping columns.
   * - Group By
     - This node computes aggregations of a group of rows against selected grouping column by applying selected aggregate functions on specified aggregate columns.
   * - Pivot By
     - This node creates a DataFrame based on the Pivot table created out of the incoming DataFrame. Pivot table is created by Aggregation of rows by applying the Aggregate functions on the Aggregate Columns against the Grouping and Pivot Columns selected.
   * - Rollup
     - Rollup Node generates a result set that shows aggregates for a hierarchy of values in the selected columns.
 

Cube
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Cube`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates usage of ``Cube`` node to compute aggregated value against all possible combinations of values in selected Cube columns.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming Dataset.
*	Filters incoming Dataset based on requirement. Here, dataset is filtered for selected Departments.
*	Aggregated value (Sum of Salary) is computed using ``Cube`` node against all possible combinations of values in selected Cube Columns (Location and Dept).
* 	Aggregated data is printed using Print node.

**Cube Node configuration**

*	It computes aggregation against all combinations of selected Cube columns values. Aggregated value (Sum of Salary) is computed using ``Cube`` node against all combinations of selected Cube Columns (Location and Dept) values.
*	Columns from incoming datasets against whom Aggregated values need to be calculated are to be selected as ``Cube Columns``. Multiple columns can be selected as ``Cube Columns``.
*	Columns on which aggregated values need to be computed are to be selected as ``Aggregated Columns``. If aggregated values need to be calculated on multiple columns then additional rows need to be added.
*	Function that needs to be used for Aggregated Value calculation is to be selected in ``Aggregate Operation To Use``. It can be different for each row.

Group By
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Group By`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates the usage of ``Group By`` node to compute aggregation of data by grouping rows together based on ``Group By`` columns.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming dataset.
*	Aggregated value (Sum of Salary) is computed with the use of ``Group By`` node by grouping rows together based on Group By column (Location).
* 	Aggregated data is printed using the Print node as shown below:

**Group By Node configuration**

*	It computes aggregation of data by grouping rows together based on Group By columns. Aggregated value (Sum of Salary) is computed using ``Group By`` node by grouping rows together based on ``Group By`` column (Location).
*	Columns from incoming Datasets against whom Aggregated values need to be calculated are to be selected as ``Grouping Columns``. Multiple columns can be selected as ``Grouping Columns``.
*	Columns on whom aggregated values need to be computed are to be selected as ``Aggregated Columns``. If aggregated values need to be calculated on multiple columns then additional rows need to be added.
*	Function that needs to be used for Aggregated Value calculation is to be selected in ``Aggregate Operation To Use``. It can be different for each row.
*	``Where Clause`` and ``Having Clause`` in the ``Filter Setting`` tab can be used to filter outgoing dataset.

Pivot By
----------------------------------------

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Pivot By`` processor in Fire Insights. It demonstrates the usage of ``Pivot By`` node to compute aggregation of data using Grouping columns and displayed against each Pivot Column value.

It does the following processing of data:

*	Reads incoming dataset.
*	Aggregated value (Employee Count) is computed with the use of ``Pivot By`` node by grouping rows together based on ``Group By`` column (Department) and displayed against each ``Pivot Column`` value (Location).
* 	Aggregated data is printed using the Print node.
