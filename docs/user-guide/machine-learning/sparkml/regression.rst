Regression
==========

Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line (or a more complex linear function) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.

     - Description
   * - Linear regression
     -  LinearRegression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
     
   * - Generalized linear regression
     - Contrasted with linear regression where the output is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, generalized linear models (GLMs) are specifications of linear models where the response variable Yi follows some distribution from the exponential family of distributions

   * - Decision tree regression
     - Decision trees and their ensembles are popular methods for the machine learning tasks of classification and regression. Decision trees are widely used since they are easy to interpret, handle categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, do not require feature scaling, and are able to capture non-linearities and feature interactions.
     
   * - Random forest regression
     - Random forests are ensembles of decision trees. Random forests combine many decision trees in order to reduce the risk of overfitting.
     
   * - Gradient-boosted tree regression
     - Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs) are ensembles of decision trees. GBTs iteratively train decision trees in order to minimize a loss function.
   
   * - Survival regression
     - Survival Analysis is a set of statistical tools, which addresses questions such as ‘how long would it be, before a particular event occurs’; in other words we can also call it as a ‘time to event’ analysis.
    
   * -  Isotonic regression
     - Isotonic regression is the technique of fitting a free-form line to a sequence of observations under the following constraints: the fitted free-form line has to be non-decreasing everywhere, and it has to lie as close to the observations as possible.
   
   
Linear Regression
+++++++++++++++++++

The interface for working with linear regression models and model summaries is similar to the logistic regression case.

When fitting LinearRegressionModel without intercept on dataset with constant nonzero column by “l-bfgs” solver, Spark MLlib outputs zero coefficients for constant nonzero columns. This behavior is the same as R glmnet but different from LIBSVM.

Generalized linear regression
+++++++++++++++++++

Contrasted with linear regression where the output is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, generalized linear models (GLMs) are specifications of linear models where the response variable Yi follows some distribution from the exponential family of distributions.

Spark’s GeneralizedLinearRegression interface allows for flexible specification of GLMs which can be used for various types of prediction problems including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and others. 

Decision tree regression
+++++++++++++++++++

Decision trees are a popular family of classification and regression methods.

Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy), each representing values for the attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played) represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.

Random Forest Regression
+++++++++++++++++++

Random forests are a popular family of classification and regression methods.

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.


Gradient - boosted Tree Regression
+++++++++++++++++++

Gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) are a popular regression method using ensembles of decision trees.

Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.


Survival Regression
+++++++++++++++++++

In spark.ml, we implement the Accelerated failure time (AFT) model which is a parametric survival regression model for censored data. It describes a model for the log of survival time, so it’s often called a log-linear model for survival analysis. Different from a Proportional hazards model designed for the same purpose, the AFT model is easier to parallelize because each instance contributes to the objective function independently.

Isotonic Regression
+++++++++++++++++++

Isotonic regression or monotonic regression is the technique of fitting a free-form line to a sequence of observations under the following constraints: the fitted free-form line has to be non-decreasing (or non-increasing) everywhere, and it has to lie as close to the observations as possible.

Isotonic regression has applications in statistical inference. For example, one might use it to fit an isotonic curve to the means of some set of experimental results when an increase in those means according to some particular ordering is expected. A benefit of isotonic regression is that it is not constrained by any functional form, such as the linearity imposed by linear regression, as long as the function is monotonic increasing.

Another application is nonmetric multidimensional scaling, where a low-dimensional embedding for data points is sought such that order of distances between points in the embedding matches order of dissimilarity between points. Isotonic regression is used iteratively to fit ideal distances to preserve relative dissimilarity order.


Software for computing isotone (monotonic) regression has been developed for the R statistical package, the Stata statistical package and the Python programming language
