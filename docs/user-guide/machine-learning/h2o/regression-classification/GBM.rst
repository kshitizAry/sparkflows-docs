H2O GBM
-------

Gradient Boosting Machine (for Regression and Classification) is a forward learning ensemble method. The guiding heuristic is that good predictive results can be obtained through increasingly refined approximations. H2Oâ€™s GBM sequentially builds regression trees on all the features of the dataset in a fully distributed way - each tree is built in parallel.

Below are the required parameters which can be specified in the H2O GBM processor:
