Clustering
==========

Fire Insights provides the following processors to perform Clustering using H2O.

H2O K-means
----------

K-means falls in the general category of clustering algorithms. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that tries to find structures in the data without using any labels or target values. Clustering partitions a set of observations into separate groupings such that an observation in a given group is more similar to another observation in the same group than to another observation in a different group.
