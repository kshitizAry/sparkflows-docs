Data Profile
=============

Data profiling is the process of examining and analyzing a dataset in order to understand its structure, content, and quality. The goal of data profiling is to gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify any issues or inconsistencies, and prepare the data for further analysis or use.

Data profiling typically involves several steps, including:

* **Data discovery**: This is the process of identifying the structure of the data, such as the number of tables, columns, and rows, as well as the data types and sizes of the columns.
* **Data exploration**: This is the process of looking at the data in a more detailed manner, such as calculating summary statistics for each column and identifying any missing or duplicate values.

Below are the steps required to perform Data Profiling in Fire Insights.

Go to the Projects Page

Go to the project page where you want to create a dataset or already have an existing one.

Select ``Datasets`` tab.
