Data Profile
=============

Data profiling is the process of examining and analyzing a dataset in order to understand its structure, content, and quality. The goal of data profiling is to gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify any issues or inconsistencies, and prepare the data for further analysis or use.

Data profiling typically involves several steps, including:

* **Data discovery**: This is the process of identifying the structure of the data, such as the number of tables, columns, and rows, as well as the data types and sizes of the columns.
* **Data exploration**: This is the process of looking at the data in more detail, such as calculating summary statistics for each column and identifying any missing or duplicate values.

Below are the steps for Data Profiling in Fire Insights.

Go to the Projects Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the project page where you want to create a dataset or already have an existing one.

select ``Datasets`` tab.

Once you click on the Dataset profile, it will take you to the next page.

Click on the ``RUN DATA PROFILING`` option

Once you click on the above option, will get notifications about the process is getting started.

Once the ``execution`` process is completed, after the refresh, if the process is completed successfully the status will be updated to green, and in RHS can see the execution result.
