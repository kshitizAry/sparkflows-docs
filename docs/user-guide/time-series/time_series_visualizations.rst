Time Series Visualizations
--------------------------

Visualizing time series data can be a powerful way to uncover patterns and trends in the data. There are several different types of visualizations that are commonly used for time series data.

Fire Insights provides a number of Processors for the visualization of the time series data.

     - Description
   * - Line charts
     - A line chart, also known as a line plot, is a type of chart that is commonly used to display the trend of a variable over time. Line charts are often used for visualizing time series data, such as stock prices, weather data, or other types of data that change over time.
   * - Bar chart
     - A bar chart, also known as a bar plot, is a type of chart that is commonly used to display the distribution of a dataset. When working with time series data, a bar chart can be useful for showing the distribution of the data across different time periods, or to compare the values of a variable over different time periods.
   * - Scatter plots
     - Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.  A scatter plot can be created for both univariate and multivariate data.
   * - Box plots
     - A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a type of chart commonly used to display the distribution of a dataset. A box plot can be created for both univariate and multivariate data. When working with time series data, a box plot can be useful for showing the distribution of the data across different time periods.
   * - Histogram
     - A histogram is a type of chart that is commonly used to display the distribution of a dataset. Like a box plot, a histogram can be created for both univariate and multivariate data. When working with time series data, a histogram can be useful for showing the distribution of the data across different time periods.

Charts : Line Chart
==================

Line Charts are perfect for series of data points to form a continuous line.
For example, they can be used to represent Daily sales data.

Below is a sample workflow which contains ``Time Series data`` and outputs a line chart in Fire Insights.

Configurations for visualization processors in Fire Insight:

* Set the number of columns you want to represent on **Y axis** with respect to **X axis**.
* Set the chart type based on the data type.
