Select the Options for importing the Project

There are two options when importing Projects:

* Import to a New Project

    * In this case, the selected Project would be imported as a new Project in Fire Insights. 

* Import to an Existing Project

When importing to an existing Project, there are 3 possible methods to choose from:

* Create new Workflows, Datasets, Applications, and Pipelines if matching UUIDâ€™s found

* Overwrite Workflows, Datasets, Applications and Pipelines if same UUID found

* Delete all Workflows, Datasets, Applications and Pipelines in the selected project and create new ones
