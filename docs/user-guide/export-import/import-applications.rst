When importing to an existing Project, there are 3 possible options to choose from:

* OVERWRITE APPLICATION IF SAME KEY EXISTS IN THE PROJECT
    * In this case, if the matching KEY is found, the existing project will be removed and replaced with the uploaded file 
* CREATE A NEW KEY IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS
    * In this case, if the matching KEY is found, the uploaded file will be assigned a new KEY 
* CREATE A NEW KEY
    * In this case, the uploaded file will always be assigned a new KEY
