Import Pipelines Configuration
-----------------

When importing to an existing Project, there are 3 possible options to choose from:

* OVERWRITE PIPELINE IF SAME UUID EXISTS IN THE PROJECT
    * In this case, if matching UUIDs are found, the existing project will be removed and replaced with the uploaded file 
* CREATE A NEW UUID IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS
    * In this case, if matching UUIDs are found, the uploaded file will be assigned a new UUID 
* CREATE A NEW UUID
    * In this case, the uploaded file will always be assigned a new UUID
