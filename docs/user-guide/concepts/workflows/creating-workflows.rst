Creating Workflows
------------------

Fire Insights enables users to define end-to-end workflows for data pipelining, leveraging, pre-packaged nodes for common ETL and Machine Learning Models. Workflows are then saved and executed to produce result. Fire Insights provides a very intuitive and user-friendly editor to achieve the same.
