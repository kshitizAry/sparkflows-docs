Creating Workflows
------------------

Fire Insights enables users to define end-to-end workflows for data pipelining, leveraging, pre-packaged nodes for common ETL and Machine Learning Models. Workflows are then saved and executed to produce result. 

Fire Insights provides a very intuitive and user-friendly editor to achieve the same.

Step 1: Define New Workflow
===============

Click on Create New Workflow for creating a new workflow. It supports two engines - Spark & PySpark. 

It will open the workflow editor where the workflow can be created.

Step 2 : Add New Nodes to the Workflow
===============

Workflows editor has a list of nodes menu on the LHS i.e. Node Repository. 

Clicking on any of the nodes creates it in the workspace (makes it appear on the canvas).

  * Nodes can be connected by edges.
  * Click on the grey box and drag to the next node to create an edge between them.

* Delete edge: 
  
  * Edges can be deleted by clicking on the Edge number and selecting 'Delete'.

Step 4 : Save Workflow

  * Give the workflow a name.
  * Enter the description for the workflow.
  * Click on the 'Save' button to save the newly created workflow.
  * You can also save a new version for the workflow.

Step 5 : View Workflows
===============

You can view the workflows by going to the workflows tab of the project.
