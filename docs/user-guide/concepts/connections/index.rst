Connections
===========

Sparkflows enables you to create different connections. Sparkflows comes up with two types of connections::

- Compute Connections
- Storage Connections

Compute Connections are used to connect with compute clusters. These include Databricks clusters, AWS EMR, AWS Glue, Azure HDInsights, Cloudera or Hortonworks, Kubernetes, etc.

Storage Connections are used in the workflows for reading and writing data.
