Pipeline
========

Fire supports Pipelines. Pipelines allow running workflows in a defined order.

Pipeline List
-------------

The **Pipeline tab** displays the list of Pipelines for the current Application.

Creating a Pipeline
--------------------

Each Application now allows creating Pipelines.

Below is an example Pipeline with 3 Workflows.

Executing a Pipeline
--------------------

Pipelines can be executed like workflows. When a Pipeline is executed, its execution is submitted to Airflow.

The **Pipeline tab** displays the list of Pipelines for the current Application.
