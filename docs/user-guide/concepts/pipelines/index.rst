Pipeline
========

Fire supports Pipelines. Pipelines allow running workflows in a defined order.

-------------

The Pipeline tab displays the list of Pipelines for the current Application.

Executing a Pipeline
--------------------

Pipelines can be executed like workflows. When a Pipeline is executed, its execution is submitted to Airflow.

The Pipeline tab displays the list of Pipelines for the current Application.
