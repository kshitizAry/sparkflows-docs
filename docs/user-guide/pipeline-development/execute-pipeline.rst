Execute Pipeline
==================

Executing a Pipeline in Sparkflows follows a similar process to Workflow execution when an Airflow server is not configured. If an Airflow server is configured, the Pipelines are submitted to Airflow for scheduling and execution. This document outlines the steps required to execute a pipeline.

To execute a Pipeline in Sparkflows, follow these steps:

Step 1 : Check the Pipeline Tab
-----------------------------

#. Navigate to the Pipeline tab within your application. This tab displays a list of all Pipelines in the current application.

Step 2 : Initiate Pipeline Execution
------------------------------------------

#. Find the Pipeline you wish to execute and click the **Execute** action button. 

   This can be done from the Pipeline list or directly within the Pipeline page. This action will open the Pipeline Execute page.
