- If we want the user to map the columns of the file uploaded, below are the steps for it

 * Add select boxes component to add the available column names. Set its label as ``Columns`` and make this component hidden by selecting the ``hidden`` checkbox. 

 * Added default values where ``LABEL`` is ``DISPLAY NAME``, ``VALUE`` is ``ACTUAL COLUMN NAME`` and select that field which should be considered as a required field. And don't select this value ``CLEAR VALUE WHEN HIDDEN`` because we want the default value when the component is hidden.
 
 * Add key and its value in "CUSTOM PROPERTIES" where key as ``for`` and value as property name of file component ex: ``file1``.
