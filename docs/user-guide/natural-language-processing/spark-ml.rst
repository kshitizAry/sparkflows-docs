SparkML
=======

Text analytics is a wide area in machine learning and is useful in many use cases, such as sentiment analysis, chatbots, email spam detection, and natural language processing.

Sparkflows provide the below features by leveraging Apache Spark libraries:

* **Tokenization**: Sparkflows provides tokenization functions to split text documents into individual words or tokens, which is a fundamental step in many NLP tasks.

* **Feature Extraction**: You can use Sparkflows to extract features from text data, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors, word embeddings (Word2Vec), and more, for downstream machine learning tasks.

* **Text Classification**: Sparkflows supports text classification tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization, using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Naive Bayes.

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: While Sparkflows may not have specific built-in NER models, you can implement custom NER models using Sparkflows' pipeline and integrate them into your NLP workflows.

* **Word Embeddings**: Sparkflows includes Word2Vec, an algorithm for learning word embeddings from large text corpora, which can be used for various NLP tasks, including text similarity and clustering.

* **Clustering**: You can use Sparkflows to perform text clustering tasks, grouping similar documents together based on their content, with algorithms like K-Means and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

* **Topic Modeling**: Sparkflows supports topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for discovering topics within a collection of documents.

* **Text Preprocessing**: Sparkflows provides tools for text preprocessing, including stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization, essential for cleaning and preparing text data.

* **Sentiment Analysis**: You can build sentiment analysis models using Sparkflows to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data.

* **Custom NLP Pipelines**: Sparkflows allows you to create custom NLP pipelines by combining various text processing and machine learning components into a single workflow.

* **StopWordsRemover**: Sparkflows' StopWordsRemover helps remove common stop words from text documents, improving the quality of text analysis results.

* **NGrams**: Sparkflows supports the generation of N-grams, which are contiguous sequences of 'N' words from a text document, useful for capturing context and dependencies between words.

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Sparkflows offers TF-IDF vectorization to represent the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents, commonly used in information retrieval and text analysis.

* **CountVectorizer**: Sparkflows' CountVectorizer converts text documents into a matrix of token counts, facilitating the creation of feature vectors for machine learning tasks.
