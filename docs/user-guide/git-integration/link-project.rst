Link Project with Git
===================

Sparkflows allows projects to be linked with git via the ``Link With Git`` under Actions. You can link projects with git in order to persist projects, workflows, pipelines, apps to git repo. On clicking on the button, following options show up: 

- To link to ``Existing branch`` 
- To link to ``New branch``

This document goes over how to link projects both ways.

----------------------

- Choose ``New Branch`` from the radio button.
- Provide ``Origin``. Default values usually is either ``master`` or ``main``
- Provide the ``New branch name``
