Step 1: Create Project
==============================

Before you start creating a workflow, you will need to create a ``Project``. A project is a bucket where all your artifacts such as datasets, workflows, dashboards, etc related to a project would reside. Projects are equivalent to workspaces in IDEs.   
  
* From the landing page of Fire Insights, click on ``Create Project`` to create a new project.
