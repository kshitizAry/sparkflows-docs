Step 1: Create Project
==============================

Before you start creating a workflow, you will need to create a Project. A project is a bucket where all your artifacts such as datasets, workflows, dashboards, etc. related to a project would reside. Projects are equivalent to workspaces in IDEs.   

#. **Login** to Fire Insights.
#. From the **Dashboard** page, click **Create Project** to create a new project.
