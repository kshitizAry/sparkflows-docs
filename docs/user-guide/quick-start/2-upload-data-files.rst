Step 2 : Upload Data Files

The workflow needs data to work on. So, the next step will be to upload a data file that you want to process in your workflow.

The steps involved in uploading the data files are:

#. Go to the File System Page.
#. Choose and Upload the Files.
#. View the Uploaded Files.
