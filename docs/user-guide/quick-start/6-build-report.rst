Step 6 : Create Report
------------------

Reports allow you to display the output of multiple workflows in one place.

The steps involved in creating a report are:

#. Open Reports page
#. Open Reports Designer
#. Create and Save Report 
#. View Report

Step 1 : Open Reports Page
=====================
#. Go to **Project Overview** page.
#. Click on **Reports** tab to reach the Report page.

Step 2 : Open Reports Designer 
=============================
#. From the Reports page, cilck on **Create New Report or Create Report** button.
   
   This would open up the Report Designer Page.

#. Give a name to your Report. You can also add a description for the new Report.

Step 3 : Create and Save Report
===================================

#. On the left hand side of the Report Designer, the list of workflows would show up. With each workflow, the nodes inside the workflow would be displayed.

   Nodes inside the workflow can be dragged and dropped onto canvas to make them part of the Report.

   In the dashboard below we have added two nodes to the dashboard.

#.  Click on **Save** to  save the report.

 
 
Step 4 : View Report
==================

#. Click on the  **View** button to view the report.

   The report shows the content from the latest execution of the workflow.

   If the workflow has never been executed, the dashboard would not show anything.
