Data Exploration
===========================

Data exploration, in machine learning, refers to the process of examining and analyzing a dataset in order to understand its structure, content, and characteristics. The goal of data exploration is to gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify patterns and trends, and to prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.
