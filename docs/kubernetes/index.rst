Kubernetes Guide
=========

Fire Insights is integrated with Kubernetes.

There are two scenarios:

* You have a Kubernetes Cluster and Fire Insights can integrate with it.
* You have VM's and need Kubernetes installed on it along with Fire Insights.

If you are on-premise, we recommend installing Rancher.

Fire Insights adds the following services:

  * Fire Insights : for self-serve Advanced Data Analytics.
  * Minio : for distributed storage.
  * Apache HIVE : for Data Catelog.
  * Apache Spark : for Distributed Processing.
  * Jupyter : For Machine Learning with Notebooks.

This document captures the steps for installing Fire Insights.
