Fire Configurations & Job Submission on AWS Glue
==========================

Since, you have successfully established a connection between VM on which Fire Insights is running and AWS Glue, so now we can configure Fire Insights for Glue and create workflow and submit the job on AWS Glue.

1. Login to Fire Insights application and go inside Configurations.

After logging in to Fire Insights application, click on ``ADMINISTRATION ``tab located on top to find the ``Configuration`` button. Clicking on the configuration button will take you to the configuration page.
