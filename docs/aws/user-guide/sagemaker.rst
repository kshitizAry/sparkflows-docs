Integration with SageMaker
========================

Fire is fully integrated with AWS SageMaker. Fire provides a number of processors for building models on SageMaker. 

You can do Data Preparation and Feature Engineering with Sparkflows doing compute with Apache Spark. Sparkflows, then seamlessly, enables you to do your model training and deployment with SageMaker. 

The above forms a very powerful combination for end to end Machine Learning.

Spark Sagemaker Examples
------------------------

There are a number of SageMaker-Spark examples by AWS here : 

* https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-spark
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/apache-spark-example1.html


Fire SageMaker Processors
------------------

SageMaker Processors include:

* KMeansSageMakerEstimator
* XGBoostSageMakerEstimator 
* LDASageMakerEstimator
* LinearLearnerBinaryClassifier
* LinearLearnerRegressor
* PCASageMakerEstimator
* SaveSageMaker

AWS Provided Policies
-----

AWS provides managed policies for SageMaker e.g. AmazonSageMakerFullAccess.

Launching EMR
------------

When launching the EMR cluster, make sure that the Role (eg: **EMR_EC2_DefaultRole**) used has the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy. 

Now that the Roles and Policies are in place, start up your EMR cluser with the **EMR_DefaultRole** and  **EMR_EC2_DefaultRole** Roles.

Create New Role
--------------

Create a new Role called **aws-sagmaker-full-access** with the below Policy. It would be used in the Apache Spark job when accessing SageMaker.

* AmazonSageMakerFullAccess

Use ARN of the new Role in the Workflow
----------------

We, now, use the ARN of the new Role while using the SageMaker KMeans Estimator Node in the Workflow.

**arn:aws:iam::account_id:role/aws-sagemaker-full-access**


AWS Instance Types
------------------

AWS has various instance types:

* p : GPU Instances
* c : Compute Instances
* r : Memory Optimized Instances
* m : General Instances

Amazon SageMaker Instance Types details are available here : https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/instance-types/


Dataset Column Names for Training with Sagemaker
------------------------------------------------

SageMaker needs the following columns to exist in the dataset.

* label : label column
* features : features column


Flow with Sparkflows and AWS
---------------------------

* We do the Data Preparation and Feature Generation in EMR with Sparkflows.
* When Sparkflows invokes the SageMakerEstimator, it calls SageMaker for Training and Deployment.
* Once the model is deployed on SageMaker, the endpoint can be used for realtime predictions.

XGBoost Sagemaker Workflow
---------------------

Below is a workflow which:

* Reads in a libsvm file as input.
* Performs XGBoost Modeling.
* Reads in another libsvm file.
* Performs predictions with the model built in the previous step.
* Prints out the result.
