This document serves as a detailed guide to run Sanity tests on Sparkflows running on AWS.

Below are the steps:

1. Ensure that you can log into the system.
2. View the sample Applications.
3. Execute a workflow on EMR.

Log into the System
-------------------

* Log into the system as the ``hadoop`` user which you had created during the Deployment process.
  http://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/aws/running-on-emr.html

View the Sample Applications
----------------------------

* Go to the ``Applications/List' page.
* If you loaded the sample Applications during the deployment process, you would see some Sample Applications listed.
* Click on any of those to view their datasets/workflows etc.

Execute a workflow on EMR
------------------

* From the Applications/Workflows page.
* Click on the Execute icon next to any workflow.
* This will open up the Execute page.
* Click on ``Execute`` to execute the workflow on the EMR cluster.
