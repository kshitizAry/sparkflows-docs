AWS IAM AssumeRole
======

Fire Insights is integrated with AWS IAM Assume Role which can be Configured at Group level.

Advantage
-----

Assuming roles, instead of directly using the user, enforces the principle of least privilege. With roles, you can:

1. Restrict the use of elevated permissions to only those times when they are needed for specific tasks.
2. Explicitly grant the permission to the users to assume the role. Thus, not everyone is allowed to perform those tasks.
