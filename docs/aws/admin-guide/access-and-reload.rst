Access and Reload Samples
==============
This documentation explains how to access Sparkflows, create Users and reload sample projects.

Access Sparkflows and Create Users
---------------------

#. Obtain the public IP or DNS of your AWS instance from the AWS Console -> Instances.

#. Open a web browser and enter the following URL: http://sparkflows_IP:8080, where **sparkflows_IP** should be replaced with the actual IP or DNS of your instance.

#. By default, Sparkflows provides two user accounts: **admin** with the password **admin**, and **test** with the password **test**.

   If you need to create additional user accounts, you can do so through the Sparkflows **Administration** Tab. 
   
   To create new users, navigate to the **Users** section. On the Users page, fill in the new **User details** and click **Save** to the user.
