Overview
========

Fire Insights is fully integrated with Incorta, enabling seamless data processing and analysis. It allows users to read data from an Incorta object store via a storage connection and perform tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, profiling, feature engineering, and model building using a no-code workflow designer. Users can submit workflows to the Incorta Spark cluster through the Incorta Chidori compute connection, with results and models saved directly to the Incorta object store.
