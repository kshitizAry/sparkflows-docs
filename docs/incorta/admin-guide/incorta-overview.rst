Overview
========

Fire Insights is deeply integrated with Incorta.

Fire allows reading the data from an Incorta object store using a storage connection and do the data-cleaning, data transformation, data profiling, feature-engineering and model build with a no-code workflow designer. It allows users to submit the workflow to the Incorta Spark cluster with the Incorta Chidori compute connection and saves the results and model to the Incorta object-store.
