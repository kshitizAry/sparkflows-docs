Databricks Integration Steps
======================

Fire Insights integrates with Databricks. It submits jobs to the Databricks clusters using the REST API of Databricks and have the results displayed back in Fire Insights.

Fire also fetches the list of Databases and Tables from Databricks, making it easier for the user to build their workflows and execute them. In addition fire displays the list of Databricks clusters running for the user.

Databricks can be running on Azure or on AWS.

* Running Databricks on Azure : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal
* Running Databricks on AWS : https://databricks.com/aws


Below are the steps for Integrating Fire Insights with your Databricks Clusters.

Install Fire Insights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Fire Insights on any machine. The machine has to be reachable from the Databricks cluster.

Upload Fire Core Jar to Databricks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fire Insights jar has to be uploaded to Databricks. Fire Insights jobs running on Databricks make use of this jar file.

Upload ``fire-x.y.z/fire-core-lib/fire-spark_2_4-core-3.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`` to Databricks. Upload it under Workspace as a Library on to Databricks.

1. Login to your ``Databricks Account``


2. Click on ``Workspace`` in the left side pane

Create Databricks Connection in Fire Insights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a connection in Fire Insights to Databricks. 

It can be created by the Administrator under Administration/Global Connections. These connections are available for everyone to use.

It can also be created by any user with their Application. In this case, it is only available to the Application and its users.
