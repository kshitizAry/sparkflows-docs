Databricks Python Integration Steps
======================

Fire Insights integrates with Databricks and can submit Python jobs. It submits jobs to the Databricks clusters using the REST API of Databricks and have the results displayed back in Fire Insights.

Below are the steps for Integrating Fire Insights with your Databricks Clusters for running Python jobs.

.. note::  The Machine on which Fire Insights is installed should have Python 3.7.0 or above.

Python Installation Steps:

  * https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/installation/python-install-linux.html


Install Fire Insights
-----------

Install Fire Insights on your machines. The machine has to be reachable from the Databricks cluster.

Upload Fire wheel file to Databricks
----------------------------------

Fire Insights wheel file has to be uploaded to Databricks. Fire Insights jobs running on Databricks make use of this wheel file.

Upload ``fire-x.y.z/dist/fire-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`` to Databricks. Upload it under Workspace as a Library on to Databricks under DBFS or even in S3 Bucket which is accessible from the Databricks Cluster.

1. Login to ``Databricks Cluster``


2. Click on ``workspace`` in the left side pane

3. Create a new Library

You can select Library Source as ``DBFS``, Library Type as ``Python Whl``, provide any ``Library Name`` field, & add File Path of ``fire-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`` located in DBFS.

On Clicking on ``Create`` button it will ask to install on specific databricks Cluster, select cluster on which you want to install.

On Successfull installation of wheel file on Databricks Cluster, it would be displayed under ``Libraries``.

Another option is to upload ``fire-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`` file to s3 Bucket which is accessible from Databricks Cluster.

Once you upload ``fire-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`` file to s3 Bucket, login to Databricks Cluster & inside Libraries tab.

Install New Library & select ``DBFS/S3`` in Library Source, ``Python Whl`` in Library Type and copy paste the location of python wheel file available in s3 in File Path & Click on Install.

Install Python dependencies
-----------------------

You need to install the python dependencies required by Fire Insights on the machine by running below Command from ``fire-x.y.z/dist/fire/`` directory::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Make sure that pip etc. is already installed on that machine


Install dependency for JDBC Driver
--------------------------

Copy the ``JDBC Driver`` jar to pyspark jar path, Once it is copied successfully, you can see the JDBC Driver jar inside pyspark jar path::

    cp -r SparkJDBC41.jar $PATH_VIRTUAL_ENV/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyspark/jars/

Install dependency for AWS
--------------------------

Copy the jars ``hadoop-aws`` and ``aws-java-sdk`` to pyspark jar path.

Install any specific package of python, if Need to use in Custom Processors on databricks Cluster aswellas Fire Insights Machine.

Use the command below to install it on the Fire Insights machine::

    pip install scorecardpy

Install it on your Databricks cluster with the below::

   * Open a Notebook and attach to Databricks Cluster.
   * %sh pip install scorecardpy

Install prophet package on databricks
-------------------------------------

Install needed python package for prophet using init script on databricks cluster

::

    #!/bin/bash
    pip install pip==20.0.2
    pip uninstall -y pystan
    pip install pystan==2.19.1.1
    pip install numpy==1.17.3
    pip install prophet==1.1.1
    

add above in a script file, upload in DBFS and go to Advanced Options, select Init Scripts and add DBFS path to it

Upload Fire workflowexecutedatabricks.py file to DBFS
----------------------------------

For Python Job submission to Databricks Cluster.

Upload ``fire-x.y.z/dist/workflowexecutedatabricks.py``, file to DBFS or even S3 Bucket too.

.. figure:: ../_assets/configuration/workflow.PNG

Configure the Uploaded Library in Fire Insights
------------------------------------

Configure the path of the uploaded fire python wheel package file & workflowexecutedatabricks.py under ``databricks.pythonFile`` & ``databricks.pythonPackages`` respectively in Fire Insights.

It can be two source either ``DBFS`` or ``S3`` path.

If you have Uploaded in ``DBFS`` path.
