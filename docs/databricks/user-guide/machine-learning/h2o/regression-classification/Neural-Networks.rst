H2O Neural-Networks
-------------------

H2Oâ€™s Deep Learning is based on a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network that is trained with stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation. The network can contain a large number of hidden layers consisting of neurons with tanh, rectifier, and maxout activation functions. Advanced features such as adaptive learning rate, rate annealing, momentum training, dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, checkpointing, and grid search enable high predictive accuracy. 
You can find the details at the H2O website : https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/deep-learning.html

Below are required parameters which can be specified in the H2O Neural-Networks processor:
