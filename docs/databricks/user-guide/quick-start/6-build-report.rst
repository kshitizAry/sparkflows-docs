Give a name to your dashboard. You can also add a description for the new dashboard.


Build Report

On the left hand side of the Report Designer, the list of workflows would show up. With each workflow, the nodes inside the workflow would be displayed.

Nodes inside the workflow can be dragged and dropped onto the dashboard to make them part of the dashboard.

In the dashboard below we have added two nodes to the dashboard.
