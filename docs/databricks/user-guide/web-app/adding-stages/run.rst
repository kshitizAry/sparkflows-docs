Run Stage
======================

- In the run stage, we will execute the notebook with all parameters added to the App.

- Let's first add a title on the page if needed with the "Html element" component like below.

   .. figure:: ../../../_assets/web-app/add-stage-run-title.PNG
      :alt: web-app
      :width: 80%
   

-  Now, let's add a column component at the bottom and divide it into two columns for adding the ``back`` and ``run`` buttons.

-  Add the back button in the first column to go to the back stage and perform actions depending upon the event. Set its event name as ``back``.

-  Add the next button in the second column to go to the next stage and perform actions depending upon the event. Set its add event name as ``execute``. We can also add CUSTOM CSS     CLASS like float-right, float-left, etc.
