REST API Examples using Curl
==========

This topic contains a range of examples that demonstrates how to use the Fire Insights APIs using curl.

Acquire Session Cookie Using curl
-----------------------------

When invoking the REST APIs of Fire Insights with curl, the first step is to log in and save the incoming cookie into a text file. This file would then be used in making subsequent REST calls via curl.

Save the incoming cookies using the ``-c`` option of ``curl`` into a file.

In the examples below, Fire Insights web server is running on the local machine at: ``localhost:8080``

You can replace it with your machine name and port.

* Login and save the session cookie into /tmp/cookies.txt*::

    curl -i -X POST -d username=admin -d password=admin -c /tmp/cookies.txt localhost:8080/login
    
In the above:

    * username = admin
    * password = admin
    * Incoming cookie gets saved into : /tmp/cookies.txt
    * REST API endpoint : localhost:8080/login



There are various categories of REST API's available:
